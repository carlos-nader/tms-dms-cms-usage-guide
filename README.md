# Falcon BMS TMS/DMS/CMS HOTAS Usage Guide

A structured LaTeX-based reference guide for mastering the Target Management Switch (TMS), Display Management Switch (DMS), and Countermeasures Management Switch (CMS) in Falcon BMS 4.38.1.

## Project Overview

This project creates a professional, context-driven usage guide for three critical HOTAS switches in the F-16C/D aircraft modelled in Falcon BMS 4.38.1. The guide bridges the gap between official technical documentation (Dash-1, Dash-34, Training Manual) and practical, day-to-day virtual flying operations.

### What It Is

- A comprehensive reference organized by **master mode** and **sensor context**
- A collection of **context-sensitive tables** documenting each switch's behavior
- **Cross-referenced** to official BMS documentation and training missions
- Built with professional governance: version control, file naming standards, and project tracking

### What It Is Not

- A full HOTAS manual (focuses exclusively on TMS, DMS, CMS)
- A tactics textbook (tactical notes are brief and contextual only)
- Official Falcon BMS documentation (community effort, non-affiliated)

## Current Status (v0.2.2.0 — January 8, 2026)

## Versioning Scheme

The project uses a **4-part semantic versioning system** with two distinct regimes:

### Pre-Publication (0.x.x.x)

Used during scaffolding and content development:

- **MAJOR** = 0 (always)
- **MINOR** = chapter integration order
- **PATCH** = structural changes within chapters
- **SUBPATCH** = typos, wording, minor table refinements

**Current track:** `0.2.x.x` — CMS chapter structure underway

### Post-Publication (x.y.z, ≥ 1.0)

Used after first public release (`1.0.0`):

- **MAJOR** = edition number (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)
- **MINOR** = significant compatible revisions
- **PATCH** = corrections and polish

**Detailed rules:** See `VERSION-SYSTEM-V4.2.docx` in `docs/`

## Governance Documents

The project is governed by four key documents housed in `docs/`:

### 1. **BRIEFING** (v0.1.4.1)
Project specification: scope, style rules, layout parameters, content guidelines, and AI collaboration standards. Required reading for understanding what goes into the guide.

### 2. **VERSION-SYSTEM** (v4.2)
Authoritative rules for semantic versioning, file naming patterns, version increment triggers, and synchronization protocols across LaTeX macros, file names, and tracking documents.

### 3. **WIP NAMING CONVENTION** (v1.3)
Standardized naming for all work-in-progress files (chapters, sections, tables, notes, visuals) with status codes, organization rules, and automation hints.

### 4. **PROJECT TRACKING** (v5.0.0)
Session-by-session timeline, milestones, WIP file status, integration priority, and completion history. Updated at the end of each development session.

**Status:** Currently in `.docx` format. Markdown equivalents are planned to be published to `docs/` as the project progresses.

## File Naming Standards

The project enforces strict file naming conventions:

### Master Guide File
```
guide-vMAJOR.MINOR[.PATCH[.SUBPATCH]]-YYYYMMDD.tex
Example: guide-v0.2.2.0-20260108.tex
```

### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Files
```
[TYPE]-[CHAPTER]-[SECTION]-[COMPONENT]-[STATUS]-[DATE].tex
Example: section-C5-S2-cms-actuation-hotas-tables-review-2026-01-08.tex
```

**Types:** `section`, `table`, `visual`, `notes`  
**Status codes:** `wip` (active), `review` (under review), `approved` (ready for integration), `archive` (historical)

## Key Documents in the Guide

### Chapters (Planned Structure)

1. **Introduction** — Scope, authorship, sources, how to read
2. **HOTAS Fundamentals** — SOI, timing, master modes, overview table
3. **TMS — Target Management Switch** — Concept + all master modes and sensors
4. **DMS — Display Management Switch** — SOI architecture and MFDS format control
5. **CMS — Countermeasures Management Switch** — CMDS/ECM interaction and tables
6. **Training References and Practical Flows** — Mission progression, checklists
7. **HOTAS Visual Reference** — Stick/throttle diagrams with quick-reference labels

### Appendices

- Block / variant notes (differences across F-16CM variants)
- Tables index (cross-reference of all TMS/DMS/CMS tables)

## Content Structure: hotastable Format

All TMS/DMS/CMS behavior tables follow a standardized 7-column format:

| Column | Width | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **State** | 1.6 cm | Master mode + sensor/weapon context |
| **Direction** | 1.0 cm | Hat direction: Up, Down, Left, Right |
| **Action** | 1.0 cm | Press type: Short, Long, Short repeated, Long hold |
| **Function** | 3.4 cm | What the switch does (informal title) |
| **Effect / Nuance** | 5.8 cm | Technical explanation + interactions |
| **Dash34** | 1.4 cm | Reference to BMS Dash-34 sections |
| **Train** | 1.4 cm | Recommended BMS training missions |

This format ensures consistent, dense, professional documentation while maintaining easy navigation.

\dashrefs{s1, s2, ...} % Multiple Dash-34 references
```

## Sources and References

The guide is conceptually aligned with (but never reproduces) official Falcon BMS documentation:

- **TO BMS 1F-16CMAM-34-1-1** (Dash-34) — Avionics & Weapons Manual
- **TO BMS 1F-16CMAM-1** (Dash-1) — Flight Manual / Systems
- **Falcon BMS Training Manual 4.38.1** — 33 missions with learning objectives
- **Falcon BMS User Manual 4.38** — General systems reference

All content is paraphrased in original words. No copyrighted text is reproduced.

## Collaboration Model

**This is a personal documentation effort**, maintained transparently for the benefit of the Falcon BMS flight simulation community.

### Current Stage

- **Open for:** Review, structural feedback, and source validation
- **Not open for:** External contributions (until v1.0.0 public release)

After the first public release (`1.0.0`), external contributions will be considered under a to-be-determined contribution policy.

## How to Use This Repository

### For Developers / Contributors

1. Review the **BRIEFING** (`docs/BRIEFING-v0-1-4-1.docx`) for scope and style rules
2. Check the **VERSION-SYSTEM** for versioning decisions
3. Follow the **WIP NAMING CONVENTION** when creating new files
4. Update **PROJECT TRACKING** at the end of each session
5. Commit changes with clear messages referencing version and component

### For Readers

The final compiled guide (PDF) will be released with version `1.0.0`. Until then, the source `.tex` files and supporting documents in `docs/` provide insight into the project structure and technical approach.

## Build Instructions (Planned)

Build scripts and compilation instructions will be documented as the project stabilizes. For now, the project uses standard LaTeX tooling:

```bash
pdflatex guide-v0.2.2.0-20260108.tex
```

(Full build process with auxiliary files, index generation, and PDF optimization will be documented separately.)
