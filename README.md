# Falcon BMS HOTAS TMS/DMS/CMS Usage Guide

A comprehensive **LaTeX-based technical guide** documenting F-16 HOTAS switch systems (Throttle Management Switch, Data Management Switch, and Countermeasures Management Switch) for Falcon BMS 4.38.1.

---

## 📖 About This Project

This project develops a structured, production-quality guide explaining HOTAS functionality across multiple F-16 blocks and international variants. The guide serves both novice and experienced pilots, covering conceptual frameworks, switch actuation, system interactions, and operational nuances grounded in official technical manuals (Dash-34, Dash-1) and training materials.

**Current Status:** Pre-publication phase (v0.2.2.0) — Chapter scaffolding and narrative consolidation underway.

## 📋 Key Documentation

### Governance Layer

The project uses **three integrated governance documents** (in `/docs/`) that define rules, structure, and workflows:

1. **Briefing Document**
   - Project scope, content outline, and style guidelines
   - Layout standards and table formatting rules
   - Current status & roadmap

2. **Naming Conventions Guide**
   - Rules for organizing WIP files (sections, tables, visuals, notes)
   - Status lifecycle: dev → review → final → approved → deprecated
   - How to create and track new WIP files

3. **Versioning System**
   - Guide version numbering (0.x.x.x pre-publication, x.y.z post-publication)
   - MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH/SUBPATCH semantics
   - Integration workflow from WIP to guide snapshots

4. **Project Tracking** (living document)
   - Session-by-session progress log
   - WIP status snapshot
   - Integration timeline & milestones
   - Current priorities & phases

All governance documents are available in **Markdown** (for editing) and **DOCX** (for sharing).

## 🔄 Workflow

### For Contributors & Developers:

1. **Create**: Copy template from `TEMPLATES/` to `WIP/` folder
2. **Name**: Follow naming conventions (use interactive HTML tool in root if needed)
3. **Develop**: Edit file with status (`dev` → `review` → `final` → `approved`)
4. **Review**: Human review of narrative, accuracy, and style alignment
5. **Archive**: Integrate approved files into guide, move to `ARCHIVE/`
6. **Track**: Update project tracking document with new version & session log

### File Status Codes:
- **dev** — Draft stage; not ready for review
- **review** — Under human review; open for feedback
- **final** — Approved and ready for integration
- **approved** — Integrated into guide and archived
- **deprecated** — Intentionally retired or superseded
