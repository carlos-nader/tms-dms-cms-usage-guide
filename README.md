\# Falcon BMS TMS/DMS/CMS HOTAS Guide



LaTeX-based guide for Falcon BMS F-16 Flight Simulator covering TMS/DMS/CMS HOTAS switches functions, usage, and practical procedures.



\## Project Goals



\- Provide a clear, pilot-friendly reference for TMS, DMS, and CMS HOTAS usage in Falcon BMS.

\- Bridge the gap between official documentation (Dash-1, Dash-34, Training Manual) and day-to-day sim flying.

\- Maintain professional governance: versioning, WIP file naming, and project tracking.



\## Scope



This repository focuses \*\*only\*\* on:



\- TMS (Target Management Switch)

\- DMS (Display Management Switch)

\- CMS (Countermeasures Management Switch)



Other cockpit controls are mentioned only when strictly necessary for context.



\## Current Status



\- Project phase: \*\*Scaffolding (Phase 0)\*\*  

\- Main guide file: `guide-v0-2-2-0-20260108.tex` (pre-publication)  

\- Governance documents (currently in Word format, to be migrated to Markdown):

&nbsp; - BRIEFING

&nbsp; - VERSION-SYSTEM

&nbsp; - WIP NAMING CONVENTION

&nbsp; - PROJECT TRACKING



\## Repository Structure (in progress)



Planned and partially implemented structure:



\- `WIP/` — Work-in-progress LaTeX sections, tables, and related PDFs.

\- `ARCHIVE/` — Approved WIP files and older guide versions for historical reference.

\- `docs/` — Governance and tracking documents (currently `.docx`, later `.md`).

\- `VERSOES/` or existing structure — Original folders kept for compatibility during migration.



\## Versioning



Versioning follows a custom 4-part semantic scheme:



\- `0.x.x.x` — Pre-publication (scaffolding and drafting)

\- `x.x.x`  — Post-publication releases



Detailed rules are defined in the internal \*\*VERSION-SYSTEM v4.1\*\* document and will later be mirrored here in Markdown.



\## Governance



The project is governed by four key documents:



\- \*\*BRIEFING\*\* — Scope, style, layout, and constraints.

\- \*\*VERSION-SYSTEM\*\* — Version numbering and release rules.

\- \*\*WIP NAMING CONVENTION\*\* — File naming rules for WIP sections, tables, notes, and visuals.

\- \*\*PROJECT TRACKING\*\* — Timeline, priorities, WIP status, and integration history.



These documents currently live in `docs/` as `.docx` and will be progressively mirrored as Markdown.



\## Collaboration



This repository is primarily a personal documentation effort.  

It is public for transparency and for the benefit of other Falcon BMS pilots who may learn from the structure and content.



External contributions may be considered after the first public release (`1.0.0`).
