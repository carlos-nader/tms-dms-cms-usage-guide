## 📖 About This Project - ![Perplexity](https://img.shields.io/badge/perplexity-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=perplexity&logoColor=088F8F)

This project develops a structured guide explaining HOTAS functionality across multiple F-16 blocks and international variants. The guide serves both novice and experienced pilots, covering conceptual frameworks, switch actuation, system interactions, and operational nuances grounded in Falcon BMS manuals (Dash-34, Dash-1) and training materials. 

**Current Status:** Pre-publication phase (v0.x.x.x) — Chapter scaffolding and narrative consolidation underway.

## 📋 Key Documentation

### Governance Layer

The project uses **four integrated governance documents** (in `/docs/`) that define rules, structure, and workflows.

![Github Pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/github%20pages-121013?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) https://carlos-nader.github.io/tms-dms-cms-usage-guide/

1. **Briefing Document (BRIEFING-v0.2.0.1.md)**
   - Project scope, content outline, and style guidelines
   - Layout standards and table formatting rules
   - Current status & roadmap

2. **WIP Naming Conventions Guide (WIP-FILE-NAMING-v1.4.md)**
   - Rules for organizing WIP files (sections, tables, visuals, notes)
   - Status lifecycle: dev → review → final → approved → deprecated
   - How to create and track new WIP files

3. **Versioning System Guide (VERSION-SYSTEM-v4.2.1.md)**
   - Guide version numbering (0.x.x.x pre-publication, x.y.z post-publication)
   - MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH/SUBPATCH semantics
   - Integration workflow from WIP to guide snapshots

4. **Project Tracking (PROJECT-TRACKING-v5.0.0.md)** — Living document
   - Session-by-session progress log
   - WIP status snapshot
   - Integration timeline & milestones

## 🔄 Workflow (WIP Files)

### For Contributors & Developers:

1. **Create**: Copy template from `TEMPLATES/` to `wip/` folder
2. **Name**: Follow naming conventions (use interactive HTML tool in root if needed, or guides in `docs/`)
3. **Develop**: Edit file with status (`dev` → `review` → `final` → `approved`)
4. **Review**: Human review of narrative, accuracy, and style alignment
5. **Archive**: Integrate approved files into guide, move to `archive/`
6. **Track**: Update project tracking document with new version & session log

### File Status Codes:
- **dev** — Draft stage; not ready for review
- **review** — Under human review; open for feedback
- **final** — Approved and ready for integration
- **approved** — Integrated into guide and archived
- **deprecated** — Intentionally retired or superseded
