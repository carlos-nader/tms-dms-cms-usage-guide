# TMS/DMS/CMS Usage Guide focused on Falcon BMS F-16 Flight Simulator

A comprehensive **LaTeX-based technical guide** documenting F-16 HOTAS switch systems (Throttle Management Switch, Data Management Switch, and Countermeasures Management Switch) for Falcon BMS F-16 Fligth Simulator.

The author is by no means affiliated to or endorsed by Falcon BMS or its developers. This guide is not an official Falcon BMS guide or manual. It's intended to help Falcon BMS Community.

## 📖 About This Project

This project develops a structured guide explaining HOTAS functionality across multiple F-16 blocks and international variants. The guide serves both novice and experienced pilots, covering conceptual frameworks, switch actuation, system interactions, and operational nuances grounded in Falcon BMS manuals (Dash-34, Dash-1) and training materials.

**Current Status:** Pre-publication phase (v0.x.x.x) — Chapter scaffolding and narrative consolidation underway.

## 📋 Key Documentation

### Governance Layer

The project uses **three integrated governance documents** (in `/docs/`) that define rules, structure, and workflows:

1. **Briefing Document**
   - Project scope, content outline, and style guidelines
   - Layout standards and table formatting rules
   - Current status & roadmap

2. **WIP Naming Conventions Guide**
   - Rules for organizing WIP files (sections, tables, visuals, notes)
   - Status lifecycle: dev → review → final → approved → deprecated
   - How to create and track new WIP files

3. **Versioning System Guide**
   - Guide version numbering (0.x.x.x pre-publication, x.y.z post-publication)
   - MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH/SUBPATCH semantics
   - Integration workflow from WIP to guide snapshots

4. **Project Tracking** (living document)
   - Session-by-session progress log
   - WIP status snapshot
   - Integration timeline & milestones
   - Current priorities & phases

All governance documents are available in **Markdown** (for editing) and **DOCX** (for sharing).

## 🔄 Workflow (WIP Files)

### For Contributors & Developers:

1. **Create**: Copy template from `TEMPLATES/` to `WIP/` folder
2. **Name**: Follow naming conventions (use interactive HTML tool in root if needed, or guides in `DOCS/`)
3. **Develop**: Edit file with status (`dev` → `review` → `final` → `approved`)
4. **Review**: Human review of narrative, accuracy, and style alignment
5. **Archive**: Integrate approved files into guide, move to `ARCHIVE/`
6. **Track**: Update project tracking document with new version & session log

### File Status Codes:
- **dev** — Draft stage; not ready for review
- **review** — Under human review; open for feedback
- **final** — Approved and ready for integration
- **approved** — Integrated into guide and archived
- **deprecated** — Intentionally retired or superseded

## 🛠️ Tools & Utilities

### WIP Naming Generator
Interactive HTML tool in project root for generating compliant WIP file names based on chapter, section, status, and date.

### Markdown-to-DOCX Converter
Batch script (using Pandoc) to export governance documents from Markdown to DOCX format for convenient sharing and reading - see CONVERTER-SETUP.docx in `MISC/` for further instructions about the md converter bat file.
