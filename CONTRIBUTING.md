## 🔄 Contribution Workflow

### For Content & Technical Contributions:

#### **Option A: Report Issues & Suggestions** (Easiest)

1. **Email** a detailed description to: **carlos.snm@gmail.com**

   - Highlight any dependencies or related WIP files

5. **Review & Integration:**
   - Maintainer will review for accuracy, style, and alignment with governance
   - Feedback will be provided via email
   - Once approved, your file moves to `final` status and integration into the guide

### For Governance & Infrastructure Contributions:
