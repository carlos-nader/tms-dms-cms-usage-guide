## 0. How to Use This Document

### 0.1 Initial Question 🤔

Before any version change, answer:

- **Does the guide already have a published edition (≥ 1.0)?**
  - **No** → apply the **Pre-publication Regime (0.x.x.x)** 📝  
  - **Yes** → apply the **Post-publication Regime (x.x.x)** 🎯  

### 0.2 Decision Steps ⚙️

1. **Identify the type of change made in the work session:**
   - Did a **new chapter** enter the main guide file?
   - Was there a **strong restructuring** of sections or of how tables organize content?
   - Were there only **small adjustments** to text, formatting, or table cells?

2. **Go to the appropriate "When to Increment" table:**
   - If still in 0.x.x.x → use **Quick Reference (0.x.x.x — pre-publication)** 📋  
   - If already in ≥ 1.0 → use **Quick Reference (x.x.x — post-publication)** 📊  

3. **Apply the File Naming Workflow:**
   - Update the **version and date macros** in the guide's LaTeX preamble.
   - Update the **`.tex` file name** with the new number and date.
   - Update **PROJECT-TRACKING** with the new entry.
   - Archive the previous version in the appropriate folder.

### 0.3 Scenario-Based Examples 🎬

- **"I finished the narrative of a new chapter, tables still incomplete."**
  - Regime: 0.x.x.x  
  - Trend: **MINOR** goes up (new chapter in development), PATCH/SUBPATCH at 0 ✍️  

- **"I filled part of an important table in an existing chapter, changing how the reader uses that chapter."**
  - Regime: 0.x.x.x  
  - Trend: **PATCH** (structural change inside the chapter) 🔄  

- **"I only fixed typos in two chapters, without changing structure or table logic."**
  - Regime: 0.x.x.x or x.x.x, depending on current state  
  - Trend: **SUBPATCH** (in 0.x.x.x) or **PATCH** (in x.x.x) ✏️

## 1. Header and Scope

### 1.1 Metadata 📌

- **Title:** Falcon BMS TMS/DMS/CMS Guide Version System v4.2  

- **Role:** defines how to name, number, update, and archive versions of the TMS/DMS/CMS guide  

- **Current project regime:**
  - While no edition ≥ 1.0 has been declared, the project is in **0.x.x.x pre-publication regime** 🔴  
  - After the first published edition, the project will combine:
    - Historical 0.x.x.x line (frozen) 🗂️  
    - Active versions in **x.x.x (≥ 1.0, post-publication)** 🟢  

### 1.2 Purpose 🎯

- Establish a versioning system that:
  - ✅ Clearly distinguishes **internal work (0.x.x.x)** from **published editions (≥ 1.0)**
  - ✅ Aligns **MAJOR** with the guide "edition", instead of internal phases (scaffold/tables/review)
  - ✅ Treats **tables as part of chapters**, not as independent versions

### 1.3 Scope 📑

- Applies to:
  - Main guide file: `guide-v*.tex`
  - Derived artifacts: versioned PDFs, section files (`section-*.tex`), tracking documents (`PROJECT-TRACKING-*.md`), briefings  
  - **Individual preparation file names follow their own rules, defined in a separate `WIP-FILE-NAMING v*` file (`section-`, `table-`, `visual-`, `notes-`).**

- Does not apply to other projects outside the TMS/DMS/CMS Guide unless explicitly stated.

### 1.4 Version Fields in the Guide's LaTeX 🏷️

The main guide file contains version and date macros in the preamble, for example:

```latex
\newcommand{\docversion}{0.1.4.0}     % Document version number
\newcommand{\docbuild}{20260106}      % Build date YYYYMMDD
\newcommand{\docstartdate}{05 January 2026}
\newcommand{\docenddate}{DD MMM 2026}
\newcommand{\chapterscompletedof}{1/7}
\newcommand{\tablesfilledpct}{0\%}
\newcommand{\fulldocversion}{\docversion+\docbuild}
```

These macros are the **internal source of truth** for the document version.

On every version change:

- ✏️ `\docversion` and `\docbuild` **must** be updated to reflect the new version and new date.  
- ✏️ `\fulldocversion` and derived fields (cover page, status section, etc.) start displaying the new value.

The version number stored in these macros must **always match**:

- The number in the **`.tex` file name**  
- The number recorded in **PROJECT-TRACKING**  

---

## 2. Global Naming Convention

### 2.1 Single File Name Rule 📝

Every main guide file must follow this pattern:

```text
guide-vMAJOR.MINOR[.PATCH[.SUBPATCH]]-YYYYMMDD.tex
```

- `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, `PATCH`, `SUBPATCH` are integers ≥ 0  
- `YYYYMMDD` is the **build date** (year, month, day)  

### 2.2 Date Format 📅

- The date **always** uses the format `YYYYMMDD` (for example, `20260106` for 06 January 2026).
- The build date is updated whenever:
  - A new version number is created (bump in any digit)
  - A relevant snapshot is compiled, even without content change, when the artifact is to be archived

### 2.3 Examples 📚

- Pre-publication (0.x.x.x regime):
  - `guide-v0.1.0.0-20260105.tex`
  - `guide-v0.1.4.0-20260106.tex`

- First published edition (≥ 1.0 regime, after promotion):
  - `guide-v1.0.0-2026XXXX.tex`

- Major revision in a new edition:
  - `guide-v2.0.0-2026XXXX.tex`

---

## 3. Pre-Publication Regime (0.x.x.x)

### 3.1 Semantics of Digits in 0.x.x.x

During pre-publication, the version number has four digits:

```text
0.MINOR.PATCH.SUBPATCH
```

- **MAJOR = 0** 🔴  
  - Indicates the guide is in an **internal development line**, still **unpublished**  
  - Structure can change significantly (chapters entering, leaving, being reordered) with no stability commitment to the reader  

- **MINOR (2nd digit)** 📖  
  - Represents **which nth chapter is being worked on in the guide** (order of entry into the main file, not chapter number)
  - Examples:
    - `0.1.x.x` → 1st chapter in development (could be Chapter 1, 3, 5, etc.)
    - `0.2.x.x` → 2nd chapter in development (independent of being "Chapter 2")
    - ... up to `0.7.x.x` when the 7 planned chapters have entered

- **PATCH (3rd digit)** 🔧  
  - Marks **relevant structural changes** inside the chapter(s) active under that MINOR:
    - Addition of new important sections
    - Reorganization of sections/subsections
    - Introduction or reformulation of tables in ways that change how the chapter is used

- **SUBPATCH (4th digit)** ✍️  
  - Logs **smaller refinements** without significant structural change:
    - Spelling and typo corrections
    - Small wording improvements
    - Localized tweaks in table cells, footnotes, or formatting  

### 3.2 Increment Rules in 0.x.x.x ⬆️

Only MAJOR is fixed (0); the other digits vary according to change type.

#### 3.2.1 Central Rule 🎯

- **Only content that enters the main guide file (`guide-v*.tex`) can trigger MINOR/PATCH/SUBPATCH bumps.**  
  - Work in external WIP (`section-...tex`, `table-...tex`, `visual-...{svg,pdf,png,tex}`, `notes-...md`, drafts) **does not** change the version number until integrated.

#### 3.2.2 "When to Increment (Pre-Publication)" Table 📊

| Situation | Increment | Note |
|----------|-----------|------|
| ✨ Start working on a new chapter in the main file | **MINOR** | E.g. `0.1.x.x → 0.2.0.0` |
| 📄 Add a new relevant section in an already active chapter | **PATCH** | E.g. `0.1.1.0 → 0.1.2.0` |
| 🔄 Restructure chapter sections/subsections | **PATCH** | Keeps MINOR; changes internal architecture |
| 📋 Fill/modify tables in a way that changes how the chapter is used | **PATCH** | E.g. new HOTAS table that reorganizes reading |
| ⚠️ Fix LaTeX syntax errors that prevented compilation | **PATCH** | Structural "major bugfix" |
| ✏️ Fix typos, punctuation, small wording adjustments | **SUBPATCH** | E.g. `0.1.4.0 → 0.1.4.1` |
| 🎨 Adjust few table cells without changing logic/structure | **SUBPATCH** | Local refinement |
| 💾 Only compile/save, with no content change | **Date** | Update `YYYYMMDD`, not version number |
| 📁 Work in non-integrated WIP (`section-...tex`, `table-...tex`, `visual-...{svg,pdf,png,tex}`, `notes-...md`) | **None** | Version only goes up when content enters main guide |

#### 3.2.3 Internal Phases as Metadata 📌

- Phases like **"chapter scaffolding"**, **"table filling"**, **"review"** are treated as **progress metadata**, not as direct triggers for MAJOR changes in 0.x.x.x.
- These phases can show up:
  - In PROJECT-TRACKING
  - In the guide's own status section

### 3.3 Role of Tables in 0.x.x.x 📋

#### 3.3.1 Tables as Part of Chapters

- The `hotastable` environment is defined as a **presentation medium**, not as an independent structural unit.
- TMS, DMS, and CMS tables:
  - ✅ Are always **part of sections/chapters** (Ch. 3, 4, 5, etc.)
  - ✅ Are indexed in the table appendix, reinforcing that they belong to main chapters

#### 3.3.2 Tables and Version Increments 🔢

- **PATCH because of tables** when:
  - Inclusion, removal, or large reformulation of a table:
    - Changes how the reader navigates or understands the chapter
    - Reorganizes content (e.g. replacing free text with a central reference table)

- **SUBPATCH because of tables** when:
  - Adjustments:
    - Fix cell descriptions, typos, or references
    - Add/remove few rows without changing overall logic
    - Adjust formatting, colors, reference notes

### 3.4 Practical Examples (0.x.x.x) 🎬

#### 3.4.1 Pre-Publication Evolution Line 📈

- `v0.1.0.0` — Introduction structured and included in guide (1st chapter in development) ✍️  
- `v0.1.3.0` — TMS chapter structured, with main sections defined 📖  
- `v0.1.4.0` — DMS chapter restructured; geometry fixes; new table layout adopted 🔧  
- `v0.2.0.0` — 2nd chapter in development enters guide (for example, HOTAS fundamentals) ✨  
- `v0.3.0.0` — 3rd chapter in development enters guide (for example, CMS), and so on, until:  
- `v0.7.0.0` — All 7 planned chapters have entered the guide (scaffolding complete) 🎉  

#### 3.4.2 Mini-Cases by Scenario 🔍

- **Case A — New chapter (Ch. 2) enters the guide:**
  - Situation: until now, only Introduction was included as a developed chapter
  - Action: integrate Ch. 2 structure into the main file
  - Version: `0.1.4.0 → 0.2.0.0` ⬆️  

- **Case B — DMS restructuring in Ch. 4:**
  - Situation: sections reordered, subsections regrouped, narrative adjusted
  - Version: `0.1.3.0 → 0.1.4.0` (PATCH) 🔄  

- **Case C — Partial filling of TMS `hotastable` in Ch. 3:**
  - Situation: first table version that reorganizes how the chapter is understood
  - Version: PATCH within the corresponding MINOR, e.g. `0.1.4.0 → 0.1.5.0` 📋  

- **Case D — Typo fixes in Introduction and TMS:**
  - Situation: only typos and micro wording adjustments
  - Version: `0.2.3.0 → 0.2.3.1` (SUBPATCH) ✏️  

---

## 4. Bridge to Publication (0.x.x.x → 1.0)

### 4.1 Criteria to Declare 1.0 ✅

A `0.a.b.c` version can be promoted to `1.0.0` when all criteria below are met:

- **Overall chapter structure is stable** 📖  
  - All chapters planned for the 1st edition exist and have basic narrative complete
  - The chapter index reflects the structure to be "frozen" for readers

- **Guide is practically usable** 🛠️  
  - A reader can follow the flow and use TMS/DMS/CMS based on existing text
  - Tables may be partial, **as long as this is clearly indicated** (for example, labels like "In development" or explanatory notes)

- **Minimum consistency and clarity review done** 🔍  
  - Unified terminology (mode names, commands, displays, etc.)
  - Critical references (Dash-1, Dash-34, Training Manual) checked at key points

### 4.2 Transition Procedure 🔄

1. **Choose base 0.a.b.c** 🎯  
   - Select, among existing 0.x.x.x versions, the one that best represents the state "ready for 1.0"
   - Confirm it meets the criteria in Section 4.1

2. **Create version 1.0.0** 🎉  
   - Update macros in the main guide LaTeX:

   ```latex
   \newcommand{\docversion}{1.0.0}
   \newcommand{\docbuild}{YYYYMMDD}  % Date when 1st edition is frozen
   ```

   - Save the file with the new name:

   ```text
   guide-v1.0.0-YYYYMMDD.tex
   ```

3. **Freeze the 0.x.x.x line** ❄️  
   - Move all `guide-v0.*.tex` files to a history folder, for example:

   ```text
   /prepub/guide-v0.*.tex
   ```

   - **Do not create new 0.* versions** after 1.0.0 is born.
   - The 0.x.x.x line becomes pre-publication history only.

4. **Update tracking** 📝  
   - In PROJECT-TRACKING, record:
     - Which `0.a.b.c` version was promoted to `1.0.0`
     - A short **editorial justification** for promotion (why this is the 1st edition)
     - The path/identifier of the archived PDF `guide-v1.0.0-YYYYMMDD.pdf`

### 4.3 Cutover between Regimes 🔀

- From the build date recorded in `\docbuild` of version `1.0.0` onward:
  - **All new changes** to the guide must follow the **x.x.x regime** described in Chapter 5.
  - That is, any new version takes the form `1.MINOR.PATCH`, then `2.MINOR.PATCH`, and so on.

### 4.4 Checklist before Promoting to 1.0.0 ✔️

Before performing the transition, validate:

- ✅ `\chapterscompletedof` and the chapter index correctly reflect the 1st edition's state (for example, they do not advertise chapters that do not yet exist)
- ✅ There are no obvious internal "markers" (like "TODO", "FIXME", temporary comments) in the main sections
- ✅ Partial tables are clearly identified as such and do not look like "errors"
- ✅ PROJECT-TRACKING is consistent with the state to be frozen as 1.0.0 (dates, versions, change descriptions)

---

## 5. Post-Publication Regime (≥ 1.0, x.x.x Scheme)

> 🚀 From `1.0.0` onwards, the focus moves from internal development to **edition and revision management** for readers.

### 5.1 Semantics of Digits in x.x.x

After the first published edition, the guide uses:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR (1st digit) — Guide edition** 📕  
  - Represents **main editions** (1st, 2nd, 3rd, …)
  - Should only change when there are broad enough changes to justify calling it a "new edition"
  - Typical examples:
    - Large chapter reorganization (merges, splits, strong order changes)
    - Addition/removal of large content blocks that alter global scope
    - Adaptation to a new major BMS version requiring substantial rewrite of several chapters

- **MINOR (2nd digit) — Compatible but substantial changes** 🔄  
  - Marks **important revisions**, but still within the **same edition**
  - A reader of the current edition does not "get lost" when moving to a new MINOR:
    - Index and overall structure remain recognizable
  - Examples:
    - Addition of a new relevant chapter
    - Large expansion of existing chapters (new sections and key tables)
    - Relevant internal reorganization of a subset of chapters while keeping global architecture

- **PATCH (3rd digit) — Smaller corrections and adjustments** 🔧  
  - Logs **fine-tuning** within the same MINOR:
    - Spelling, grammar, formatting fixes
    - Clarity improvements in paragraphs, captions, notes
    - Small table, note, reference adjustments
    - Local error corrections without large restructuring

### 5.2 General Increment Rules in x.x.x ⬆️

#### 5.2.1 General Principles

1. **Editorial compatibility** ✅  
   - If the reader can use the new version as a **drop-in replacement** for the previous one, without relearning global structure → generally **not MAJOR**
   - If the new version requires rethinking stable references (chapter number, global order) → **candidate for MAJOR**

2. **Frequency** 📊  
   - **MAJOR** is rare (editions)
   - **MINOR** is less rare, but still signals important revisions
   - **PATCH** can happen more frequently (errata, polish)

3. **Continuity with 0.x.x.x** 🔗  
   - 0.x.x.x becomes pre-publication history; in ≥ 1.0, avoid unnecessary architecture "resets"

#### 5.2.2 "When to Increment (Post-Publication)" Table 📋

| Situation | Inc. | Comment |
|----------|------|---------|
| 🔄 Reorganize chapter structure (merges, splits, large order changes) | **MAJOR** | Reader sees it as a "new edition of the guide" |
| 📚 Add/remove large content blocks that change global scope | **MAJOR** | E.g. whole new part, or removal of a dominant part |
| 🆕 Adapt guide to a new major BMS version with substantial rewrite of several chapters | **MAJOR** | Old content is no longer fully current |
| ✨ Add a **new important chapter** within the same edition | **MINOR** | Scope expands, edition remains the same |
| 📖 Substantially expand one or more chapters (new sections, key tables) | **MINOR** | Significant improvement without breaking global organization |
| 🔧 Reorganize internally a subset of chapters, keeping index recognizable | **MINOR** | "Revised edition" within same MAJOR |
| ✏️ Correct several localized content errors in text/tables | **PATCH** | Focus on fixing, not expanding scope |
| 📝 Fix typos, grammar, improve clarity, update references | **PATCH** | Typical errata/polish versions |
| 🎨 Adjust few table cells, change labels without altering logic | **PATCH** | No chapter renumbering or flow changes |

### 5.3 Role of Tables in ≥ 1.0 📊

- **Tables are part of chapters**, not MAJOR artifacts:
  - A new **large, central table** in an important chapter:
    - May justify **MINOR**, if expansion is substantial
    - Or **PATCH**, if it is just a refinement of already described content

- **Localized table corrections** (cells, acronyms, notes):
  - Tend to be **PATCH**, unless the change is so broad that it modifies the logic of a key section (then evaluate MINOR)

### 5.4 Example Progression in x.x.x 📈

#### 5.4.1 From the 1st Edition Onward

- `1.0.0` — **1st published edition** 🎉  
  - Stable chapter structure, usable narrative, tables present and clearly marked when partial

- `1.0.1` — **Initial errata** 🔍  
  - Typo fixes, small errors in TMS/DMS/CMS descriptions, localized formatting tweaks

- `1.1.0` — **Expanded revision within 1st edition** 📚  
  - Addition of one new relevant chapter (for example, advanced training flows)
  - Some tables originally from 0.x.x.x have been completed

- `1.1.3` — **Third set of minor fixes on top of 1.1.0** ✅  
  - `1.1.1`, `1.1.2`, `1.1.3` accumulate errata and clarifications

- `2.0.0` — **2nd revised edition** 🚀  
  - Several chapters regrouped, order revised, broad updates to follow a new major BMS version

#### 5.4.2 Decision Examples 🤔

- **Case 1 — New chapter "TMS/DMS/CMS in additional aircraft" in 1.x**
  - Global structure stays recognizable → `1.0.2 → 1.1.0` (MINOR) ✨  

- **Case 2 — Fixing incorrect commands in CMS tables**
  - Cell-level fixes, no chapter restructuring → `1.1.0 → 1.1.1` (PATCH) ✏️  

- **Case 3 — Reorganizing training part (Ch. 6) into two parts**
  - If only part of structure changes, with recognizable index → **MINOR** 🔄  
  - If it triggers wide architecture changes → evaluate **MAJOR** 📕  

### 5.5 Interaction with 0.x.x.x History 📁

- **0.x.x.x** versions:
  - Kept as **pre-publication history**, useful for understanding evolution and didactic decisions 📚  

- After `1.0.0`:
  - No new 0.* versions are created.
  - All future changes follow x.x.x regime ✅  

### 5.6 Quick Checklist for ≥ 1.0 ✔️

1. **Does your change alter the edition (reader should perceive it as "new edition")?**
   - Yes → **MAJOR** (e.g. `1.3.2 → 2.0.0`) 📕  
   - No → continue…

2. **Does your change significantly expand scope or reorganize an important part, while staying in same edition?**
   - Yes → **MINOR** (e.g. `1.0.0 → 1.1.0`) 🔄  
   - No → continue…

3. **Is your change local (fixes, clarifications, small table/text adjustments)?**
   - Yes → **PATCH** (e.g. `1.1.0 → 1.1.1`) ✏️  

---

## 6. Rules Common to Both Regimes 🔗

### 6.1 Build Date and Compilation 📅

- **Build date (`YYYYMMDD`)** must be updated whenever:
  - A new version number (0.x.x.x or x.x.x) is established ✅  
  - A relevant snapshot is compiled and saved 💾  

- Difference between internal snapshot and official version:
  - Only versions whose number was updated in `\docversion` and in the file name enter PROJECT-TRACKING as milestones 📌  

### 6.2 File Naming Workflow 📝

Single workflow for 0.x.x.x and x.x.x:

1. **Determine change type** 🔍  
   - Use the appropriate "When to Increment" tables (pre- or post-publication)

2. **Update version/date macros in LaTeX** ✏️  
   - Set `\docversion` to the new number
   - Set `\docbuild` to the new `YYYYMMDD` date
   - Ensure `\fulldocversion` reflects the correct combination

3. **Compile and check for errors** 🔧  
   - Generate the PDF and check LaTeX warnings/errors

4. **Rename the `.tex` file** 📄  
   - Apply the pattern:

   ```text
   guide-vMAJOR.MINOR[.PATCH[.SUBPATCH]]-YYYYMMDD.tex
   ```

5. **Update PROJECT-TRACKING** 📊  
   - Add a line with version, date, affected chapter(s), and a concise description of the change

6. **Archive previous version** 🗂️  
   - Move the `.tex` and optionally the `.pdf` to the appropriate history folder (`/prepub/` or `/published/`)

### 6.3 Archival Strategy 📦

- Organization by regime:
  - `/prepub/guide-v0.*.tex` — internal development history 📚  
  - `/published/guide-v1.*.tex`, `/published/guide-v2.*.tex`, etc. — published editions and revisions 🎯  

- Git (optional):
  - Version only `.tex` and text files
  - Exclude artifacts via `.gitignore`:

  ```text
  *.pdf
  *.docx
  *.aux
  *.log
  *.synctex.gz
  ```

### 6.4 Relationship with WIP File Naming 🧩

- This document (**Version System v4.2**) governs **only** the versioning and naming of the main guide file (`guide-v*.tex`) and its history.  
- Individual preparation files (`section-`, `table-`, `visual-`, `notes-`) follow their own rules defined in the separate **`WIP-FILE-NAMING v*`** document.  
- These WIP files **only impact the guide version** when their content is actually integrated into `guide-v*.tex` (i.e. when they modify the main file's content).

## 7. Consolidated Quick Reference 🎯

### 7.1 Quick Reference (0.x.x.x — Pre-Publication) 📝

- **MAJOR = 0** always  
- **MINOR:** new chapter enters main guide ✨  
- **PATCH:** structural change in chapter (sections/tables altering flow) 🔄  
- **SUBPATCH:** fine-tuning (typos, wording, small table tweaks) ✏️  

| Key Situation | Pre Version (ex.) | Post Version (ex.) |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| ✨ New chapter enters guide | `0.1.4.0 → 0.2.0.0` | — |
| 🔄 Restructure chapter sections | `0.2.1.0 → 0.2.2.0` | — |
| 📋 Important table changes chapter usage | `0.2.2.0 → 0.2.3.0` | — |
| ✏️ Typos and micro wording fixes | `0.2.3.0 → 0.2.3.1` | — |

### 7.2 Quick Reference (x.x.x — Post-Publication) 🚀

- **MAJOR:** new edition (broad changes, potential incompatibility) 📕  
- **MINOR:** compatible but substantial expansion (new chapters, large blocks) 🔄  
- **PATCH:** minor corrections, clarifications, localized adjustments ✏️  

| Key Situation | Pre Version (ex.) | Post Version (ex.) |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 📕 2nd revised edition (broad change) | — | `1.3.2 → 2.0.0` |
| ✨ Important new chapter within same edition | — | `1.0.0 → 1.1.0` |
| ✏️ Minor fixes and clarifications on 1.1.0 | — | `1.1.0 → 1.1.1` |

### 7.3 Key Notes 💡

- **Tables** are always part of chapters; they **never define MAJOR alone** 📊  
- **0.x.x.x** is never a published edition; it is always an internal development regime 🔴  
- **1.0** marks the first published edition; **2.0**, **3.0**, etc., are successive editions, consistent with good technical documentation practice 📚  

---

**End of document — Version System v4.2** ✅
