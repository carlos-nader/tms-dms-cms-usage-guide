# GitHub Issue Templates — Installation Guide

## 📦 What You Have

4 YAML template files for GitHub issue creation:

1. **wip-dev-template.yml** — [WIP DEV] Create structure and first draft
2. **wip-review-template.yml** — [WIP REVIEW] Review and refine content
3. **wip-final-template.yml** — [WIP FINAL] Approve and lock
4. **wip-approved-template.yml** — [WIP APPROVED] Integrate and release

---

## 📥 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Create Folder in Your Repository

In your GitHub repository, you need to create a special folder structure:

```
seu-repo/
├─ .github/
│  └─ ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
│     ├─ wip-dev-template.yml
│     ├─ wip-review-template.yml
│     ├─ wip-final-template.yml
│     ├─ wip-approved-template.yml
│     └─ config.yml (optional)
```

**If `.github/` doesn't exist:**
- Create it at repository root
- Then create `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` folder inside

**If `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` already exists:**
- Just add the 4 YAML files

### Step 2: Copy Files

Copy each YAML file into `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

```bash
# From your local machine:
cp wip-dev-template.yml your-repo/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
cp wip-review-template.yml your-repo/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
cp wip-final-template.yml your-repo/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
cp wip-approved-template.yml your-repo/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
```

**Or via GitHub Web UI:**
1. Go to your repo
2. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Path: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/wip-dev-template.yml`
4. Paste content from the file
5. Commit
6. Repeat for other 3 templates

### Step 3: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
git commit -m "feat: Add GitHub issue templates for WIP workflow"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify

1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click "Issues" tab
3. Click "New Issue"
4. You should see a prompt: **"Choose an issue type"**
5. Templates should appear as options:
   - ✅ [WIP DEV] Define structure and generate first version
   - ✅ [WIP REVIEW] Review content and refine
   - ✅ [WIP FINAL] Approve and lock for integration
   - ✅ [WIP APPROVED] Integrate into guide and create release

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Templates Not Appearing

**Problem:** You click "New Issue" but don't see the templates.

**Solution:**
1. Verify folder path: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (exactly)
2. Verify filenames end with `.yml` (not `.yaml`)
3. Files must be committed to `main` branch (not in draft)
4. Wait 5 minutes and refresh GitHub page
5. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Template Name Wrong

**Problem:** You see filenames instead of nice names in the chooser.

**Solution:**
- Check `name:` field in YAML file (line 1)
- The `name:` value is what appears in GitHub UI
- Must come **before** `description:`

### Checklist Items Not Working

**Problem:** Checkboxes don't appear or are malformed.

**Solution:**
- YAML indentation must be exactly 2 spaces (not tabs)
- Each `- label:` must be same indent level as others
- Verify no trailing spaces
